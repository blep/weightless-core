DONE:
- decide what to do with out-of bound data, it doesn't seem to be used in TCP. -> NOTHING
- check is socket.send() actually send all data, if not, send the rest in a subsequent loop
- use recv buffer half the size of what getsockopt returns -- it seems that the kernel duplicates the buffer for internal administration, and that this duplicated size is reported.


TODO:
- create a facade for wlsocket/wlselect: open(url, generator) -> status
- let WlPool record/log crashed threads for inspection in test or diagnosing a live system
- let WlSelect record/log generators that came to an unnatural end.


OPTIMIZATIONS
- when socket.send, send only partial data, concatenate remaining bytes with new bytes to send?
