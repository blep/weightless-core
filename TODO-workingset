QUESTIONS/Philosophical annotations for this workingset:
========================================================

- Yield / stepping "on" is an invasive change for compose users.

    "-ng"/Gio like would help considerably, but is no small step.

- Next smallest integration step.  Possibly:
    
    Reactor() -> PeriodicDownload [meresco-components] -> OaiDownloadProcessor() [meresco-oai]

    And after OaiDownloadProcessor, switch back to the old behaviour (compose without stepping).
